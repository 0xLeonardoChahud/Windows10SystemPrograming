# Windows 10 System Programming
## Description
This is a repo where I aim to complete every exercise proposed by Pavel Yosifovich in his book "Windows 10 System Programming". The contents here are meant to help those beginning to read the book or are introducing themselves into the Windows programming world.
You will see some projects that do explore some of the key concepts explained by the book, but are entirely my own and should serve as additional material. Also, those projects have a header "[ Personal xx ]" to warn you that they are my own.
## How to read the repo
Everything is in the code. I attempt to explain each part of the code as clear as possible, trying to balance mathematical formalism (when needed) and cohesiveness in order to make it an easy-to-read material.
I have organized the solution into several projects where each project consists of an exercise or a set of exercises. It should be really straightforward to find the exercises in the repo.
In the header of each "main.cpp" file you will find a list of exercises that were done in the project that you are currently in.
